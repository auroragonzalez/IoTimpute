function [c]=iso2aniso(ciso,angle,ratio);% iso2aniso                 - convert isotropic to anisotropic coordinates (Jan 1,2001)%% Do the transformation which is reciprocal to the transformation made by% the aniso2iso.m function, so that applying successively both transformation% has no effect on the coordinates. The function maps a set of coordinates% in an isotropic space into a set of coordinates in an anisotropic one. %% SYNTAX :%% [c]=iso2aniso(ciso,angle,ratio); %% INPUT :%% ciso    n by d   matrix of coordinates for the locations in the isotropic%                  space. A line corresponds to the vector of coordinates at a%                  location, so that the number of columns corresponds to the%                  dimension of the space. Only two dimensional or three dimensional%                  space coordinates can be processed by this function.% angle   1 by d-1 vector of angle values that characterize the anisotropy. %                  In a two dimensional space, angle is the trigonometric angle%                  between the horizontal axis and the principal axis of the%                  ellipse. In a three dimensional space, spherical coordinates%                  are used, such that angle(1) is the horizontal trigonometric%                  angle and angle(2) is the vertical trigonometric angle for the%                  principal axis of the ellipsoid. All the angles are measured%                  counterclockwise in degrees and are between -90° and 90°.% ratio   1 by d-1 vector that characterize the ratio for the length of the axes%                  for the ellipse (in 2D) or ellipsoid (in 3D). In a two dimensional%                  space, ratio is the length of the principal axis of the ellipse%                  divided by the length of the secondary axis, so that ratio>1. In a%                  three dimensional space, ratio(1) is the length of the principal%                  axis of the ellipsoid divided by the length of the second axis, %                  whereas ratio(2) is length of the principal axis of the ellipsoid%                  divided by the length of the third axis, so that ratio(1)>1 and%                  ratio(2)>1.%% OUTPUT :%% c       n by d   matrix having the same size as ciso, that gives the new coordinates%                  in the anisotropic space.%% NOTE :%% It is possible to specify an additional index vector, taking integer values from 1% to nv. The values in index specifies which of the nv variable is known at each one% of the corresponding coordinates. The ciso matrix of coordinates and the index vector% are then grouped together using the MATLAB cell array notation, so that ciso={ciso,index}.% This allows to perform the same coordinate transformation at once on a set of possibly% different variables. The output variable c is then also a cell array that contains% both the new matrix of coordinates and the index vector.%%%%%% Determine the dimension of the space and set ratio isindex=iscell(ciso);if isindex==1,  d=size(ciso{1},2);else  d=size(ciso,2);end;angle=angle*2*pi/360;ratio=1./ratio;%%%%%% When d<2 or d>3, errorif (d<2)||(d>3),  error('iso2aniso.m requires coordinates in a 2D or 3D space');end;%%%%%% Case for d=2if d==2,  R=[ cos(angle)  sin(angle)     -sin(angle)  cos(angle)];  if isindex==1,    c=ciso;    c{1}(:,2)=c{1}(:,2)*ratio;    c{1}=c{1}*R;  else    c=ciso;    c(:,2)=c(:,2)*ratio;    c=c*R;  end;end;%%%%%% Case for d=3if d==3;  phi=angle(1);  teta=angle(2);  ratioy=ratio(1);  ratioz=ratio(2);  R1=[ cos(phi)   sin(phi)  0      -sin(phi)   cos(phi)  0       0          0         1];  R2=[ cos(teta)  0  sin(teta)       0          1  0      -sin(teta)  0  cos(teta)];  R=R2*R1;  if isindex==1,    c=ciso;    c{1}(:,2)=c{1}(:,2)*ratioy;    c{1}(:,3)=c{1}(:,3)*ratioz;    c{1}=c{1}*R;  else    c=ciso;    c(:,2)=c(:,2)*ratioy;    c(:,3)=c(:,3)*ratioz;    c=c*R;  end;end;
