function [k]=kurtosis(Z);% kurtosis                  - experimental kurtosis coefficient (Jan 1,2001)%% Compute the experimental kurtosis coefficients for% a set of variables. The kurtosis coefficient is a% measure of the "flatteness" of a distribution,% compared to a Gaussian distribution. The theoretical% kurtosis coefficient is defined in a way that it is% equal to zero for Gaussian distributed variables, and% lower or greater than zero for distributions which are% flatter or sharper than the Gaussian distribution,% respectively. %% SYNTAX :%% [k]=kurtosis(Z); %% INPUT :%% Z    n by nv    matrix of values for the different variables, where%                 each column corresponds to the values of one variable.%% OUTPUT :%% k    1 by nv    vector of estimated kurtosis coefficients.[m,n]=size(Z);u1=mean(Z);u2=(std(Z).^2);dev=(Z-kron(ones(m,1),u1));u4=sum(dev.^4)/(m-1);k=(u4./(u2.^2))-3;
