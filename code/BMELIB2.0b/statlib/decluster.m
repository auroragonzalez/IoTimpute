function [w]=decluster(c,model,param);% decluster                 - spatial declustering weights (Jan 1,2001)%% Compute the spatial weights associated with values. These weights% reflect the information content of the values ; values which% have close coordinates will tend to exhibit similar values and % will have smaller weights than isolated values. The weight% associated with an isolated value is thus higher than the weight% for a value located inside a cluster. Weights in the decluster.m% function are based on the kriging weights for estimating a constant% mean over the area. Negative kriging weights are taken in absolute% values and are normalized in order to sum to one. %% SYNTAX :%% [w]=decluster(c,model,param);%% INPUT :%% c      n by d   matrix of coordinates for the variable. A line%                 corresponds to the vector of coordinates at a%                 location, so that the number of columns corresponds%                 to the dimension of the space. There is no restriction%                 on the dimension of the space.% model  string   that contains the name of the variogram or covariance%                 model which is used for the computation.% param  1 by k   vector of values for the parameters of model, according%                 to the conventions for the corresponding variogram or %                 covariance model.%% OUTPUT :%% w      n by 1   vector of weights associated with the c coordinates.%                 Weights are positive and sum to one.%% NOTE :% % For a detailed discussion about the coding of the model and param% variables for nested variogram or covariance models and for space/time% cases, the reader is referred to the detailed description given for% the kriging.m fuction. Only one variable can be used in this function.n=size(c,1);unit=ones(n,1);[K]=coord2K(c,c,model,param);K=[K,unit;[unit',0]];k=[zeros(n,1);1];w=K\k;w=abs(w(1:n));w=w/sum(w);
