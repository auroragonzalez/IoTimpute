(Jan 1,2001)%% Compute the product between two probability distribution % functions, where the first pdf is discretized and the second% is referred to by its name or is discretized too.%% SYNTAX :%% [pdfc]=pdfprod(z,pdf1,pdf2,pdf2param); %% INPUT :%% z           n by 1        vector of values sorted in ascending order.% pdf1        n by 1        vector of values for the first probability%                           distribution function defined at the z values.% pdf2        string/n by 1 string that contains the name of a probability%                           distribution function, or vector of values for%                           the second probability distribution function%                           defined at the z values.% pdf2param   1 by k        vector of parameters for pdf2 when pdf2 is a string%                           that contains the name of a probability distribution%                           function.
