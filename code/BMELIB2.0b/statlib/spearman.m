function [Cs]=spearman(Z);% spearman                  - experimental Spearman's correlation matrix (Jan 1,2001)%% Compute the Spearman's rank correlation matrix between a set% of variables. To the opposite of the Pearson's correlation matrix% obtained from the raw values (see the corrcoef.m function), the% Spearman's correlation matrix is based on a relative ranking of% these values. This allows to measure the degree of association in% a set of variables when the relations between these variables are% monotonic but non linear. For variables that are linearly related,% Pearson's and Spearman's correlation matrices yield very similar% values.%% SYNTAX :%% [Cs]=spearman(Z); %% INPUT :%% Z    n by nv    matrix of values for the different variables, where%                 each column corresponds to the values of one variable.%% OUTPUT :%% Cs   nv by nv   matrix of estimated Spearman's correlation coefficients. [R]=value2rank(Z);Cs=corrcoef(R);
